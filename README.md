To optimize performance and prevent information overload, the book list is displayed using optimized pagination. This means that only a certain number of books will be loaded initially, and additional books will be loaded as you scroll down the page (infinite scrolling with lazy loading).

You can easily browse through the book list and view important details such as the book title, author, genre, and publication year. Each book is presented in a visually appealing format with an accompanying book cover image.

## Search Bar And Filters

The Library Management Page features a powerful search bar that allows you to search for books based on various criteria, including book name, author name, genre, and year of publishing. As you type your query, the search bar will provide suggestions, helping you find the desired books more easily. The Library Management Page provides real-time book count information to keep you informed.
